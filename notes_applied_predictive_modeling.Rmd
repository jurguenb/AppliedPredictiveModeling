# 1. General Strategies 

## 2. A Short Tour of the Predictive Modeling Process 

### 2.1 Case Study: Predicting Fuel Economy

* The first step in the modeling proccess is to understand the data 

* The next step is to build and evaluate a model on the data. 
    + Resampling - taking diferent versions of the training data is the way to have realistic evaluation. 
    
### 2.2 Themes 

#### Data Splitting 

* The key here is to have a splitting strategy that emululates the reality of the problem. 
* The size of the data set is pivotal.

#### Predictor data

* Sometimes a predictor can be usefull for a specific portion of the population. 

#### Estimating Performance
